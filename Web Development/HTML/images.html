    alt is use to specify when the image is not found on the net 
    <img src="" alt=" " />  ## in this way you can close the image tab 

    The main problem is of resizing the image
    as soon as we open the page, the image is very huge 
    So you handle those by height and width
    they both are in pixels

    When using the pictures see the aspect ratio of the orginal picture
    In that way change the height OR width of the image on the website,
    Change in one will automatically adjust the other for same image aspect ratio
  
    Include controls in the video tag else video will not run on the website
    
    The aspect ratio scene is same for video as that of image thing

    poster in the video tag will be use to create the thumbnail problem
